Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D student at UCSB, fortunately advised by Prof. [William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/) and Prof. [Wenbo Guo](https://henrygwb.github.io/). Previous, I have spent time at Microsoft, advised by Prof. [Jingdong Wang](https://jd92.wang/) and Prof. [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/). 

My current research interest lies in the development of trustworthy AI systems and evaluation of foundation models.

- Trustworthy AI:
  - Reinforce the robustness of foundation models to unexpected inputs (RiFT ICCV'23, PromptRobust CCS'24 LAMPS Workshop).
- Evaluation of foundation models:
  - Dynamic evaluation for test data contamination issue (DyVal ICLR'24, DyVal 2 ICML'24).
