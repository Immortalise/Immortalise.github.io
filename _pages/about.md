Iâ€™m a third-year Master student at the State Key Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I have also spent time at Microsoft, advised by Prof. [Jingdong Wang](https://jd92.wang/) and Prof. [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/). 

My research interest lies in the development of trustworthy AI systems and evaluation of foundation models.

- Trustworthy AI:
  - Reinforce the robustness of foundation models to unexpected inputs, such as adversarial examples, jailbreak prompts, etc.
  - Detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC).
- Evaluation of foundation models:
  - Dynamic evaluation for test data contamination issue.
  - New evaluation measurements for generation models.
  - Evaluation benchmarks reflecting diverse real-world scenarios.
