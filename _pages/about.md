Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D student at UCSB, fortunately advised by Prof. [William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/) and Prof. [Wenbo Guo](https://henrygwb.github.io/). Previous, I have spent time at Microsoft, advised by Prof. [Jindong Wang](https://jd92.wang/) and Prof. [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/). 

My current research interest lies in the development of trustworthy AI systems and evaluation of foundation models.

- Trustworthy AI:
  - Robustness ([RiFT ICCV'23](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Zhu_Improving_Generalization_of_Adversarial_Training_via_Robust_Critical_Fine-Tuning_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf), [PromptRobust CCS'24 LAMPS Workshop](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3689217.3690621)).
  - Prompt Injection ([MELON, ICML 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05174))
- Evaluation of foundation models:
  - Dynamic evaluation for test data contamination issue ([DyVal ICLR'24](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gjfOL9z5Xr), [DyVal 2 ICML'24](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=DwTgy1hXXo)).
